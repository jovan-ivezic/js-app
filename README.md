Webpack + SASS + Handlebars + Dev Server Boilerplate
==================

To get started run:
`npm install`

The _SASS/SCSS_ code goes inside the styles directory.

The _JS_ code goes inside the app directory.

The _Handlebars_ files goes inside the templates directory.

**Changes in real time**

1. Start the _Webpack Dev Server_:
`npm run dev`

2. Go to the url:
`http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/`

3. Start to code and see the magic happens.

4. After you finish the development, run the next command to have all your code available and minified in your build directory:
`npm run build`
